# RPC-15 — Re-measure the loop's own record

U-21 instantiated for this project: the detector here is `loop.py stale`, not
reading records by eye, and its output is finite.

## Shape

A loop record — a lead, a negative, or a `swept here` status — made several
rounds ago and never checked since.

## Detector

`loop.py stale` in full; separately, records with `round: — (not re-measured)`
and sweeps marked «off-journal», which cannot be aged at all.

## Ask

Does the stated blocker still hold, and does the original probe still measure
what it measured then?

## Evidence

Re-measuring the deferral about the error-type split added a row the table had
never had — wasm — and that row held a silent stream truncation:
`items=11 events=[DONE]` instead of an error. Three deferrals re-measured in one
run, all three recorded wrongly.
