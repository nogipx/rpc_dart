# Benches

What a bench is and when it counts as valid — [../LOOP.md](../LOOP.md). The
record format — `../../skills/improvement-loop/specs/probe.md`.

Rounds 201-205 worked with one-off probes: bench registration appeared in the
skill after them, so nothing before 206 has a record here.

**`stale (sha)` does not mean broken.** It means the code under the bench's
paths has moved since its control was last run, so the next round to reuse it
repeats that control FIRST. Only a round with a control sets `valid` again.
Marked in the curate pass after round 220.

- **[P-19](P-19-sequential-reconnect-orphan-rate.md)** valid (round 241),
  rpc_dart_http2 — how often does a SEQUENTIAL reconnect orphan a connection?
  5 in 390 direct cycles, 0 in 90 through the stalling proxy, and it names WHICH
  of the three connections leaked, which is what separates this from the
  concurrent defect. Underpowered for judging a fix: read its last paragraph
- **[P-18](P-18-early-frames-through-the-proxy.md)** valid (round 240), core
  resilience and transports — do frames that arrived before the app subscribed
  survive a hop? Two controls, because one cannot tell "never existed" from
  "dropped here": 0 late through the proxy against 1 early through it and 1
  straight off the transport. Its first build measured nothing and says why
- **[P-17](P-17-retry-until-the-peer-returns.md)** valid (round 238), reconnect —
  does the recovery API work more than ONCE? Server down, four failed attempts,
  server back, a real call — twice. Records both ways it lied first: the rig
  closing its own client, and an ablation aimed at the wrong observable
- **[P-16](P-16-hpack-reference-flood.md)** valid (round 237), http2 headers —
  what does a header block cost once decoded? Attributes the decoder and the
  adapter separately: +7 MiB vs +258 MiB for the same 63 KiB block, with
  `distinct: 1` the number that refuted the first hypothesis
- **[P-15](P-15-pending-queue-dimension.md)** valid (round 236), core buffering —
  which dimension does the unlistened queue bound? Same pendingCount at three
  payload sizes while the retained bytes scale 64 -> 256 -> 1024 MiB; +549 vs
  +2 MiB through a real transport. Records the two RSS traps it was rebuilt for
- **[P-14](P-14-detach-with-a-throwing-cancel.md)** valid (round 235), core
  resilience — does a throwing `onCancel` on a user-supplied transport abandon
  it? One arm differs by that throw alone: leaked 0 vs 1, unhandled zone errors
  0 vs 1, and the reconnect that never happened
- **[P-13](P-13-ids-after-a-peer-started-reconnect.md)** valid (round 234), websocket
  and core reconnect — does the stream-id sequence survive a reconnect the PEER
  started? Two arms differing by one event: 1 then 3 when this side calls
  `reconnect()`, 1 then 1 when the socket dies first, and a dead call's
  half-close then ended a live one
- **[P-12](P-12-zero-grant-reads-as-legacy.md)** valid (round 229), core transports —
  is a zero grant read as a peer that does not participate? A FOREIGN peer driven
  at the channel level, which is the only way to reach the path: 800 KiB through
  a 64 KiB window against 20 KiB in the control
- **[P-11](P-11-connection-debt-with-a-paused-consumer.md)** valid (round 228), core transports —
  does the connection pool come back from a consumer that stops? Round 206's
  bench with a third arm; three controls reach 3072 KiB, the paused one wedges
  at the pool. Supersedes P-01, which is the same file before that arm
- **[P-10](P-10-parked-sender-learns.md)** valid (round 221), core transports —
  does a parked sender learn its call is over? Written in 210, registered in 221
  once an ablation showed it can see a credit hang
- **[P-09](P-09-watermark-survives-a-decorator.md)** valid (round 217), core resilience —
  does the stream-id watermark survive a user's decorator?
- **[P-08](P-08-refusal-survives-a-tight-cap.md)** valid (round 216), http2 and core —
  does a refusal survive the policy it just enforced?
- **[P-07](P-07-pre-method-budget-returns.md)** valid (round 215), core endpoint —
  does the pre-method byte budget come back?
- **[P-06](P-06-handler-slots-return.md)** valid (round 214), core endpoint —
  does a handler slot come back on every teardown path?
- **[P-05](P-05-slow-consumer-is-throttled.md)** valid (round 213),
  rpc_dart_http2 — a consumer that falls behind is failed; ACCEPTED behaviour,
  see [C-19](../checked/C-19-http2-refuses-a-slow-consumer.md)
- **[P-04](P-04-parked-waiters-drain.md)** stale (0d071c55), core transports —
  does an abandoned upload leave its sender parked?
- **[P-03](P-03-wrapper-keeps-the-bound.md)** stale (906437a2), rpc_dart_http2 —
  does a transport bound survive `RpcHttp2Server.transportWrapper`?
- **[P-02](P-02-http2-aborted-call-pool.md)** stale (1d5efdda), rpc_dart_http2 —
  does an http2 connection survive a cancelled stalled call?
- **[P-01](P-01-connection-window-debt.md)** stale (c48a14d8), core transports —
  how much a sender gets out before the connection pool wedges
